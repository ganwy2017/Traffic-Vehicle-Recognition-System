# Traffic-Vehicle-Recognition-System
A summer project using neural network toolbox in MATLAB for differentiating toll paying vehicles and toll-exempted travellers.  


Documentation unfinished yet!>>
code restructuring pending>>
hardware limitations regarding Gpu (better then Nvidia Computing capabilty >=3.5 required)>>
Naive segmentation approach using background subtraction, will not work on complex images with higher number of occlusions and overlapping objects>>
>>the code will not work as such because of the limitations to upload trained network and data set>> dataset have to be collected and cann be trained using ImageCNN.m>>videotrafficgmm is the main module for classification, rest are supporting components>>
appropriate path variables for test videos ,test data , trained network and various other inputs and outputs will have to be recalibrated according to your system.
>>This repository does not account for the fulfillness of purpose specified because of the limitations of data upload limits(large datasets and trained network could not be uploaded) Although it may be useful for interested users to get an idea of approach used in my project which can be used in certain common Computer vision problems
